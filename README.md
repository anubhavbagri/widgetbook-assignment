# Widgetbook Challenge

This flutter app represents a coding challenge for Flutter enthusiasts applying for a job at [Widgetbook](https://widgetbook.io).

## üîß Requirements

- [x] Using `flutter 2.10.3` (`dart 2.16.1`) - Achieved with the help of [FVM](https://fvm.app/).

## üöÄ Assignment

In this coding challenge, you will implement an application which accepts an input from the user and sends the input to a simulated backend. The flow of the user is the following:

1. The user is greeted on the home screen with the provided `Scaffold` which hosts a `TextField` and a submission `Button`.
1. The user inserts a name into the `TextField` and presses the `Button` to send the request to the simulated backend.
1. The application computes the request, while the UI waits for the response.
1. Once the request finished, the message of the response is shown in the UI below the submission button. If any error occurs while requesting from the server, an error message is shown instead.

## üèÖ Tasks

- [x] Read this documentation.
- [x] Clone (do not fork) the repository.
- [x] Understand the provided code.
- [x] Implement a `TextField` accepting a `name`.

  - make sure to verify that no invalid input (e.g. numbers) has been inserted!

- [x] Implement a `Button`.
- [x] Implement the compution of the request whenever the `onPressed` of the button is triggered.
- [x] Show the response of the simulated backend.
- [x] Upload your code to a new repository
  - do not create a fork
  - do not create a pull request
- [x] [send us the link](mailto:jens@widgetbook.io) to your repository with the solution
  - if you don't like the idea of your solution to be publicly available make sure to create a private repository and invite [JensHor](https://github.com/jenshor).
